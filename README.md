### Notes

- This project originally started in my other repository [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Torvec/tic-tac-toe) that I decided to split into two separate projects. The other is the Classic Tic Tac Toe game which can be found here: [Classic Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/Torvec/tic-tac-toe-classic)
